    <h3>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic 
        <br> cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous 
        <br>mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family 
        <br> Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown 
        <br>that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 
         <br> 7500 BC</h3>
